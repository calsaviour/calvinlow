Copy the example .env file into a new local .env file:
```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

In order to be able to access the OpenAI API from within this template, we need to use an API key.

To retrieve your OpenAI API key you need to create a user account at https://openai.com/ and access the API Keys section in the OpenAI dashboard to create a new API key.

Once obtained, copy it into the .env.local file.

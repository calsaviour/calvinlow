# Personal Dev Portfolio

An easy to use template for any developer to create an awesome portfolio!

## Getting Started

Using pnpm:

```
pnpm install
```

## Set up environment variables

### The chatbot requires an OPENAI API key in order to work. 

Copy the example .env file into a new local .env file:
```
cp .env.example .env.local
```

In order to be able to access the OpenAI API from within this template, we need to use an API key.

To retrieve your OpenAI API key you need to create a user account at https://openai.com/ and access the API Keys section in the OpenAI dashboard to create a new API key.

Once obtained, copy it into the .env.local file.

## Run the development server on localhost:3000

```
pnpm dev
```
